6,This is where you will find your question,1
7,"This app is great, it helped me realise I was being ripped off, the workers didn't think I could access my invoices.. they are now being investigated by the fraud department as it was found they were dipping into other people's funding.",1
8,"I am unable to open an account. The terms and conditions does not have a select button on it so because I haven't been able to agree to the terms and conditions, it just won't work. I have tried several times uninstalling and reinstalling, still no joy! :(( pretty disappointed as this would be so handy for me!",0
9,"The writing on the opening page overlaps. I was using the app with no issues then all of a sudden it asked me to agree to the terms and conditions for my first time logging in. It is unusable, I can't get past the log in screen.",0
10,"So far so good this app has every possible category a person could need relating to NDIS preparation, application and structure. It takes the guess work out of applying for and managing NDIS. Just be careful when playing with the accessibility settings as they appear very sensitive and you could end up with settings you really didn't want. Other than that this app is brilliant for what it is intended.",1
11,"Recent changes have made it very hard on participants & providers. I understand changes need to be made, but Leap in did not prepare for it enough. Clients are going without daily consumables because invoices have not been unpaid or lost, or providers are not being paid. I feel sorry for all the support workers who's pays are so irregular and inconsistent now. Based on particpant comments on social media & many wanting to leave if this continues, I hope it is fixed sooner rather than later.",0
12,I can't sign up it won't let me make a account,0
13,Marked you down because I can't go back and spell check or edit my daughter's goals not can I copy and paste it to print off on another platform does not look very professional to hand in. Please hurry up an fix this . I struggle n I have to find time to start over again on another platform.,0
14,Every time I log in and click on my sons name it throws me out of the app I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it does the same thing you have problems with this app needs fixing,0
15,"Unable to log on ,tried for 15 minutes then requested a new password and stil would not let us in .Disappointing This is not good at all",0
16,"Awesome app, adore it. Got my son up and running with a new job. Now he is looking a signing up for fishing with a club. Very friendly helpful people, thank you leap in!",1
17,"I often look at this App & wonder... Should I fill this information packet out for submission to the people whom monitor at the other end of my detail, as I'm a disability pensioner. I guess it's because I worry how this information could be used against me in the future. So this is in limbo at the present time. I have Parkinsons plus other Parkinsons related issues. The way issues dealt with to stay the way it is now. I want every $ spent to be provided in good faith. I'm uninstalling. Secrecy!",1
18,It only shows your balances. Would be good if all the menu items worked and we can send claims/invoices via the app,1
19,"I cant log into the app. I am using the correct username and password, it just keeps sending me back to the login screen! Pls fix",0
20,Can the history of paid invoices please be put in order - very frustrating when February's are mixed with June and they jump all over the place,0
21,Unable to do anything in the app uninstalled and reinstalled many times. App is stuck on a loading screen,0
22,"App was great before the latest update, now the app is refusing to open... please fix!",1
23,"Crashes constantly, staff constantly enters wrong information, endless login errors and ugly interface.",0
24,Its an amazing app and is a good app to have as you can approve your invoices that you have and it explains how you can approve your invoices and you can also customise your leapin app as well,1
25,its just the app I dont think is very good. Leap in planning themselves are quite good.,1
26,The app keeps freezing or won't open.,0
27,"Great app, has made preparing for my plan meeting easy. I'm really interested in signing up for plan management, where can I find out more?",1
28,"Love it, stylish, appreciative of Leapin services",1
29,Installed and can't even open it. Good start so deleted,0
30,This app does my head in. It wouldn't open after I downloaded it. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0

32,interrupted by another infallible review when the world is turning sleep little baby the rings are on your fingers damn it did anyobe bring a match. no one brought a match,1

42,No responses to my questions,1
43,Mad App it's about time.,1
44,very much happy,1
45,I dont know how to work it,1
46,Very useful.,1
47,App doesn't open,0
48,Great application,1
49,Wow,1
50,Still learning it. But seems really easy to use and not full of mumbo jumbo talk. Plenty of help available for ppl who have time to watch/read/listen/Auslan on how to navigate My plan manager. Wasn't aware I could skip out a SAC. ðŸ‘Œ,1
51,Terrible. It says to view claims to click on new claims but then it says up to date and only offers te chance to submit a new one. It is nothing like the PC version. Not happy :(,0
52,App was working well until updated! Trouble taking photo of account it just didn't let you proceed. Several phone calls made. Seems to be working now but slightly different. Unable to view uploaded account as you could before. Says loading then BLANK white screen. Frustrating and annoying. Needs IS&T attention to get it back working how it was prior to the upgraded. App was very easy to use and worked well. This isn't the case now.,0
53,"This app and the MPM website are equally terrible. Very glitchy, doesn't let me do anything useful in it. Can't upload a photo, change my email address, add nominees like my support coordinator, etc. Says I have no plan in place even though I do. It's purely ornamental, to the point I'm seriously considering changing plan managers.",0
54,"Each time I go to a page there's no way to go back unless l completely uninstall the app and start again. The company is great, website is easy to use, staff are friendly, providers are paid quickly. But the app is useless.",0
55,U can keep up to date with expenses and what cost is left. Much easier to have a glance then contact someone,1
56,"it would be very helpful if one could view submitted invoices rather than just seeing ""invoice created"" which is not really that useful by itself. This feature is in the iOS version. It's broken in the Android version.",1
57,"This app is hopeless , it's the worst app I have ever had to deal with. It will not remember my password and I can't. So now I have to reset it. And the 'forgot password' button won't work. So how am I meant to get onto it now? yes I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it, AND STILL THE SAME THING.",0
58,The app is nice and simple to use. The ability to take snapshots of invoices is great. The credit generator is ingenious! Their service and follow up is unparalleled.,1
59,"Absolutely terrible can't log in can't change password can't do nothing on this app! just freezes now constantly worked ok on other phone I had wasn't great though! tried uninstalling , installing etc needs fixing and fast",0
60,Forgot my password amd forgot password link isn't working so I can't login! Please fix this. It was working well before the update.,0
61,Photo of invoice will not upload. Have deleted the app & started again & still no success. Have emailed & awaiting reply.,1
62,"Lousy app, every time I need to use it i have to log in again and don't always remember my password which means I've gotta change it so very frustrating using a Samsung phone and iPad",0
63,i have installed and deleted this app twice. it continues to freeze. not happy with it,0
64,terrible app. downloaded it 3 times over 6 months. cant go back once you choose an option.,0
65,"I can't see any invoice' s and can't do or see anything on the app, I'm seeing if I can change plan manager. I wouldn't use it",0
66,does not work frozen uninstalled several times same thing,0
67,can't submit a claim after the new update!,0
68,password gets confused. I've had to reset twice.,0
69,Forgot password link does not work. Useless,0
70,i can't use the app on my s20+ have been trying to get it to work for months,0
71,Ican't change the password terrible,0
72,can't change password if you forget,0
73,Doesn't work,0
74,Forgot my password doesn't respond,0
75,Just horrible,0
76,Dosent work,0
77,"Crashes regularly. Have to sign out and sign back in to see things. 
Invoices aren't showing at times so I can't approve them meaning my 
services don't get paid.",0
78,"I cant enter the cost including cents, i have to place a whole figure, would be great also if invoices were listed most recent first as oposed to alphabetical, other than those 2 things fantastic",1
79,Dont bother,0
80,Cool,1
121,It shows who you talking to.,1
122,great,1
123,awesome,1
124,Yeah,1
125,Downloaded the app for Android and there is no keyboard coming up to log in so the app is useless to me at the moment. If there is a fix please let me know as I need to use the app for my sons funding. I can only access my sons account via my laptop.,0
126,Love Plan Tracker. You are such very helpful people. Nothing is a problem for helping out those who need help. Thankyou,1
127,After entering login details... 'Go' does nothing!!! App is useless,0
128,Hasn't been loading for over a week now very annoyed.,1
129,The app is not loading properly so I can't track my daughters NDIS funding,1
130,Easy to use,1
131,Wow,1
132,"Poor UI with users who both book workers and seek work. Still driving me mad can't search for ""show password"" help in app keeps telling me how to budget, as does the help link. Can't even type into the darned help form as I can't keep enough of the form showing to read and check Nothing but infuriating, months later! Worker updated and agreement and I. Told via email but can't find update anywhere including website. A pity the update doesn't seem to have made anything work better. FFS!",0
133,Easy to use but could replicate more useful information that can be seen when you log into the actual website. Timesheet - Pretty hopeless method of entering the hours worked as you can't see the hours and minutes properly. This would be one of the KEY element that needs to be fixed immediately.,1
134,"Very hard to navigate, it redirects you to thr website to update your profile and even then its very difficult as information goes missing. Could be more user friendly and easier to navigate.",1
135,The business; so far so incompetent!!! I pity the staff. Give them a wide berth and seek disability built businesses who encourage disability employment. The app doesn't allow any payment. Workers are being messed around over money as are clients!,0
136,"The App is Great, however. I have an issue with being able to get in to the learning hub.",1
137,The messages won't load when u go into them.,0
138,I can't access the Mable app atm as it's been updating (pending) for the last 2days. Something major must be wrong as I have never had this much trouble with it before!,0
139,"The worst app I've used. You cant scroll up or down if your message is longer than your screen shows. It constantly freezes. You can't scroll the navigation strip at the bottom, so you can only select things on the screen and not go to the other pages in your account. There are so many gliches and problems that I have to use the website instead of the app.",0
140,"Great way to connect members with support. I love the platform, amazing ability to choose jobs, contact clients, and submit timesheets. Makes working as a solo trader loads simpler. Only complaint is the usability of selecting hours in the timesheets is tricky. I would like the option to text in my hours/times rather than use a scroll wheel feature, this keeps rolling when I try and put in my times and makes it challenging. Overall I love Mable and its usability",1
141,I have completed everything except my abn. Even though I have a valid abn number the app can't seem to pick it up.,0
142,"Great way to find clients that suit you. Only issue having to pay to get express pay or it can take a couple weeks. And the feedback, if a client leaves you bad feedback you can't have it deleted even if the client requests it to be deleted....so it makes you look terrible on your profile.",1
143,Not a perfect app. Whole page doesn't fit onto homescreen dimensions. Inbox messages do not fit in comment box dimensions. Don't like the way shift hours are to be entered on Timesheets (am/pm rolling ip and down is annoying).,1
144,"Excellent app and service. Absolutely prefer the signup process for Mable as opposed to Hireup. More personalised, and love the search filters. Would really like to be able to edit a job once posted though. But otherwise, gr8",1
145,"One of the worse app I've ever used... extremely slow to browse, takes ages to load new work searches and the inbox section. Mable platform is great itself but the app really needs some structural changes and improvements.",0
146,Everything has always been smooth and easy when dealing with Mable (the staff and the platform itself). 5 stars from me :),1
147,Very helpful and makes it easy to understand what can be daunting process,1
148,Not the smoothest app. The time Mable takes to process payments is pretty appalling too.,1
149,"The app keeps freezing, and I have to keep deleting and reloading.",1
150,Not able to open as it says constantly Updating please wait! Would be good if one could actually sign in and use the app...,0
151,"MUST HAVE App with NDIS SelfpayPlanning Make U feel at ease with the people you are inviting into ur HOME Absolutely EASIEST/BEST APP I have USED TO find A whole range of people with CHECKED qualifications to support my with ASD/T1D son! Mable phone staff are easy/friendly/speak clear English/SUPER HELPFUL/ALL QUESTIONS QUICKLY ANSWERED. Mable check at each stage, they support you throughout the whole process! Mable is a FANTASTIC APP THAT Covers both support & supported persons.",1
152,I used to be able to access it by clicking looking for support but now there no way of accessing my account,0
153,Needs more work still has a few problems. Terrible on iOS good on Android,1
154,I love mable but its app has a long lagging problem that drives me crazzy lol !,0
155,Cant even access app. Constantly uploading.,0
156,Far too many technical glitches to be worthwhile.,0
157,Trying to fill out my profile on Mable and it wont recognise the email address of my references.... so now i cant omplete it... wow!,1
158,"I have used Mable many times,all the workers I have got from Mable are of high standard. Would recommend Mable to anyone. Tammy",1
159,Very nice excellent service for Home phone ðŸ“± App,1
160,On the phone Pam was very friendly patient understanding and answered all my questions as I am new on the Mable Platform.,1
161,Excellent App ! Great for east beginners,1
162,Doesn't log in like the website,0
163,Nice to work with Good online support and excellent communication Support worker,1
164,"Easy ro use, quick and simple ro follow.",1
165,It stopped working after one day,0
166,Was on board until I realised I gotta do my own abn and tax. There's plenty pop ups that do that for you,0
167,I was able to download the app but cannot access it.,0
168,It made me make it through a difficult times,1
169,Too hard to get authorised,0
170,so good so far!,1
171,I can't edit my profile.,0
172,"Constantly glitches so takes several attempts to actually log in. Locks up my phone and with no other access, as going through website opens the darn app, poor performance",0
173,"The app was good, right up till the newest update. Now it won't even let me log in. Continually loads the log in screen. I'm on an Oppo A9 2020, please fix this!",0
174,The app keeps crashing it is the worst I can never use it defiently not happy with this app,0
175,Everytime I open the app it closes on me and like flashes on my screen,1
176,Easy to use App with ability to check most of the important information and perform most of the common tasks related to your individual NDIS plan,1
177,Unable to upload files to the app to claim reimbursements The upload key is inactive,0
178,Can use unless i turn my phone into fort knox,0
179,App keeps stopping,0
180,"Another shocker from the incompetent boffins at the AU governmemt. Sign in by MyGov tells me to use a PIN, but no place to enter PIN, then tells me that my Medicare is not linked - it is. I think it will only work if you signup for Taxapp as well, no way to sort any of this out. So no way to replace Medicare card, so no health care, savings for Taxpayers, so great ""Yes Minister"" style app, no wonder the right wingers are turning to Trump and One Nation.",0
181,Seriously? After login I get texted a confirmation code but the app directs me to a blank screen. Can't even use the app... Rather appalling coming from a government service considering the oversaturation of competent software developers in the Australian job market.,0
182,"Think it is a good and useful app, especially for proof of vaccines given. As work in aged care.",1
183,"Can't login. Goes around in circles. Login, create pin, login, create pin...",0
184,"Cannot sign in, just loops back to sign in page and create a pin over and over",0
185,"Great app, not buggy and very quick to show your immunisation status.",1
186,Just dreadful. Allows one login then must uninstall and reinstall to login again. Useless.,0
187,Can't link MyGov to Medicare even with the right details/name. Apr 2021: somehow it worked so I can link Medicare to MyGov now. Wondering if I can use the digital card to visit the GP or whether I still need to carry the physical card for some reason. Would love to go all digital like ServiceNSW for the licence and Google Pay for the credit card.,1
188,"Didn't work, keep asking me to log in, create pin, log in, repeat",0
189,Very confusing system with linking codes and id etc. Just can't seem to log in,0
190,Can't log in. Keeps making log in again through my gov over and over again.,0
191,Bad service.. keep repeating login details,0
192,Stuck in login loop.,0
193,Endless loop requiring me to create and pin and log into my gov,0
194,"The main screen doesn't let you login, click login and takes you back into login page. Rather annoying as it was carrying my Medicare card and relying on this app.",0
195,This the the worst app.. it never works. It keeps asking to log in. I've set up a security passcode as requested. But each time I try to log in it keep saying log in failed. But there is no place to type in your pass code anyway. This is a complete waste of time and should be deleted from app store. Time waster!!,0
196,"Was able to log in with username and password. Pin already exists, but i just clicked next. Works fine. Can see past claims history. Was able to submit a claim, took the photo directly within the app. It uses my centerlink pin. Wish i could copy paste Medicare number by clicking the name on the card. Android 5.11",1
197,Can't even sign in properly says I have a 4 digit pin and to use next time I log on. Then fails to login. Get an email saying they linked but this same process every time I log in,0
198,"useless trying to sign in. It has me on a loop saying I needed to make a pin, and then telling me I already had a pin and to use that instead to sign in when there was no option to. I linked my medicare account on the myGov website which I think was what fixed the looping issue (another frustrating process though).",0
199,Better than I expected after reading previous reviews. No dramas setting up & signing in. Needs a big improvement to the way it displays immunisation history (currently in a PDF) if it's going to be widely used to prove Covid vaccination.,1
200,It was actually a pretty simple process to link Medicare with MyGov and then sync it to my phone. Straight forward. And yes I realise I'm saying this about a government service but there ya go.,1
201,"I have been trying to retrieve my Medicare number, and neither the myGov website, app, or Medicare helpline have an option to retrieve the number if its missing. This is quite frustrating, especially for returned travelers like myself.",1
202,"I set it up once and it said login failed, now every time I try to login it tells me I already have a pin code set and it sends me back to the start",0
203,"Unfortunately this app is really useless to many faults that keep happening, good idea, but make it work properly and it will be amazing.... I really hope this changes for the better asap",0
204,"Awful experience trying to log in, continuous loop on sign in saying there's already a pin associated to this account and then says there is no account linked to myGov. Complete waste of time.",0
205,"can't sign in, gives the log in page but after entering the details it takes you to a blank screen",0
206,Many problems to log in or even to fill up the form same as on the website.,0
207,"Like everyone else, it keep telling me to enter a pin and connect my mygov account. I created a pin and linked my account, but it keeps saying login failed. Do not download",0
208,Difficult to read vaccination record on my phone. Print is impossibly small and you cannot enlarge by tipping phone to landscape mode.,0
209,Error when trying to login,1
210,Was working fine until 1 week ago try to sign in and doesn't work.,0
211,"Unable to view Immunisation History. My Immunisation History is viewable on myGov, but can't view here",0
212,Love this Express Plus Medicare. Makes my life easy looking up my information.,1
213,I give you just 1 star because I couldn't login make always user name or password wrong,1
214,App does not accept hyphenated Surnames. Errors out stating that card is invalid. Poorly coded for a Government provided app.,0
215,Would be great if you could copy (to paste) the card number right from the app,0
216,Does not work at all for me,1
217,Patients privacy and medication jeopardised. Cumbersome superfluous details delay critical info access.,0
218,"Waste of time after sign in screen I just got a blank screen, I was sent my security code txt msg but couldn't use it. Uninstalled. Tax payer money put to good use again? I think not.",0
219,"Stuck in a login loop, created a pin first time around. Now it doesn't allow me to enter the pin but refuses to log me in without it. Typical government rubbish.",0
