### Q & A - Questions, Comments, Thoughts, Ideas & Feedback?
- While the Google Play scraper is a fairly nifty tool, the dataset does not label the sentiment polarity, subjectivity or intensity
- The Google Play scraper API may be used to get new input data or as training sets for topic selection, on top of sentiment analysis
- This project relies heavily on Kaggle dataset, as the sentiment polarity is properlly labelled and sufficient to train an NLP model that can predict new inputs sufficiently well.
